# Robot-Assisted Medical Imaging [rami-icra-2023]
> Medical imaging plays a vital role in modern clinical practice, which provides valuable information to physicians for medical diagnosis, image-guided surgeries, etc. The use of a robot acquires images and enables the controlled trajectory of the imaging system with high precision and reproducibility. Due to the boom of machine learning, the development of autonomous imaging systems gained increasing attention recently. To develop intelligent systems that robustly work in unknown environments, fundamental research continues to emerge, investigating novel approaches of visual seroving, share-control, object segmentation, scene understanding, and learning from experts' experiences.
The aim of this workshop is to bring together active research groups and clinicians, sharing the latest technological achievements in the field of robot-assisted medical imaging. By gathering world-class technical and clinical researchers, the meaningful discussion on the remaining challenges beyond technical developments like ethical issues and clinical acceptance will also be discussed during the one-day workshop.
