# Towards a Simple Framework of Skill Transfer Learning for Robotic Ultrasound-guidance Procedures 
Authors: Tsz Yan Leung and Miguel Xochicale
## Abstract: 
In this paper, we present a simple framework of skill transfer learning for robotic ultrasound-guidance procedures.
We briefly review challenges in skill transfer learning for robotic ultrasound-guidance procedures and identified the need of appropriate sampling techniques, computationally efficient neural networks models that lead to the proposal of a simple framework of skill transfer learning for real-time applications in robotic ultrasound-guidance procedures.
We present pilot experiments from twp participants (one experienced clinician and one non-clinician) looking for an optimal scanning plane of the four-chamber cardiac view from a fetal phantom.
We analysed ultrasound image frames, time series of texture image features and quaternions and found that the experienced clinician performed the procedure in a quicker and smoother way compared to lengthy and non-constant movements from non-clinicians.
For future work, we pointed out
the need of pruned and quantised neural network models
for real-time applications in robotic ultrasound-guidance
procedure.
