## Abstract
In this paper, we present a simple framework of skill transfer learning for robotic ultrasound-guidance procedures.
We briefly review challenges in skill transfer learning for robotic ultrasound-guidance procedures.
We then identify the need of appropriate sampling techniques, computationally efficient neural networks models that lead to the proposal of a simple framework of skill transfer learning for real-time applications in robotic ultrasound-guidance procedures.
We present pilot experiments from two participants (one experienced clinician and one non-clinician) looking for an optimal scanning plane of the four-chamber cardiac view from a fetal phantom.
We analysed ultrasound image frames, time series of texture image features and quaternions and found that the experienced clinician performed the procedure in a quicker and smoother way compared to lengthy and non-constant movements from non-clinicians.
For future work, we pointed out
the need of pruned and quantised neural network models
for real-time applications in robotic ultrasound-guidance
procedure.

(c) Robotic ultrasound-guidance procedures: transformations, graphical user interface and simulation using robotic US-guidance light-weight 7 degrees-of-freedom robot (KUKA LBR Med 7) \cite{Gerlach2022, Ipsen2021}.
