\begin{frame}{Conclusions and future work}

\begin{itemize}
\item We have presented a simple framework of skill transfer learning for robotic ultrasound-guidance procedures.
\item We presented sensor fusion methods and sampling rate techniques for optimal scanning plane of the four-chamber
view from two participants (one experienced clinician and one non-clinicians).
\item We analysed one experienced clinician that showed an smother and quicker procedure compare
to a lengthy and non-constant movement of non-clinician.
\item For future work, we pointed out the need of pruned and quantised neural network models
for real-time applications in robotic ultrasound-guidance procedure.
\end{itemize}
